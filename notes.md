Started Friday morning at about 11:00

Foreman start is rendering error port 5100 is already running
Can't get the Beers to render taking a different approach

Got the API to pull the beers


This.props.beers.map is not a function WHY IS THIS GIVING ME AN error
IN NONE OF MY OTHER PROJECTS IS THIS AN ERROR AND THEY ARE EXACTLY THE SAME SYNTAX
