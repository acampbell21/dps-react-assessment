Started Friday morning at about 11:00

Foreman start is rendering error port 5100 is already running
Can't get the Beers to render taking a different approach

Got the API to pull the beers


This.props.beers.map is not a function WHY IS THIS GIVING ME AN error
IN NONE OF MY OTHER PROJECTS IS THIS AN ERROR AND THEY ARE EXACTLY THE SAME SYNTAX

Having trouble getting the API to store beers in a state, the command is pulling the beers from api tho according to the foreman terminal

Sunday at 5:34 starting over because nothing is working/giving me a massive amount of unfixable errors

9:04 Trying to get atleast something to render on the page but according to the redux extension beers are being saved to the state as entries and I cant figure out how to access the entries part of state. This whole project is super confusing and defies anything I have done before. I see that the console is pulling the first 50 beers from the api, I cant tell if the server saves the beers under the name "Beers", I used Postman to get the details behind what is going on and there is a "Name" component to the Beers from the server but when I try to use {name} in a <div> it pulls no information from the server....... This project sucked.
